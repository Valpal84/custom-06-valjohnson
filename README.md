# Project Introduction
With this project I'm going to create my own data pertaining to inventor levels for a crafting business. For this example there will be various different inventory items and varying inventory levels relating to random dates and times. I'm going to create a producer to read in these different inventory levels that are associated with random dates and times. Then I will create a consumer that will read the inventory levels from the producer and create a line chart that will showcase different inventory levels that are available for the items listed during the random dates and times. In addition to the creation of the chart I'm going to create an SMS alert for inventory levels that dip below five with the suggestion of reordering recommended.
